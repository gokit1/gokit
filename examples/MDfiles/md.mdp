;cut-off distance for the short-range neighbor list (NOTE: cut-offs should be longer if running a CA model than an AA model). 3.0 nm is about 2.5 times the typical longest interaction in a CA model. Using a cutoff of 2.0 nm is completely reasonable as a 12A contact will have only ~1% of its potential energy at that distance. We leave 3.0 nm here for safety, but if you know what you are doing feel free to decrease to 2.0 nm. If you have longer contacts, then of course increase these numbers.

;NOTE on comm_mode: When using periodic boundary conditions, which improves the speed of neighbor searching, removing the angular velocity will lead to a warning at the grompp stage of simulations. So long as the box size is properly sized, such that your system does not cross the boundaries, then this warning is harmless and you can simply issue -maxwarn X, where X is the number of allowed warning messages.
